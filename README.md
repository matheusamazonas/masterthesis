# Master Thesis

LaTeX source code for my Master's thesis report and presentation. 

The title was "Developing Real Life, Task Oriented Applications for the Internet of Things".

The thesis was part of my Master's in Computing Science (Software Science specialization) at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/) (Nijmegen, the Netherlands).

The repository files are extracted from a ShareLatex (now Overleaf v2) project. Hence the lack of a Makefile. The report's main file is "/thesis.tex" and presentation's is "presentation/presentation.tex". The PDF for both the report and the presentation are in the repository's root folder (named "thesis-matheus-andrade.pdf" and "presentation.pdf" respectively).

Abstract
--------------
The Internet of Things is becoming ubiquitous. A growing number of objects are being equipped with devices that interact with its environment and exchange data via the Internet. Such devices are not powerful enough to run iTasks (an implementation of the Task Oriented Programming paradigm written in Clean) applications. The mTask Embedded Domain Specific Language was created with one goal in mind: to bring Internet of Things devices and the Task Oriented Pro- gramming paradigm together. But so far, only trivial applications were developed using mTask. This thesis assesses whether mTask can be used to develop real-life applications. Autohouse, the home automation application developed during the research, guided improvements in the mTask development environment and unearthed problems yet to be resolved.
