I would like to thank everyone that helped me directly or indirectly in this adventure. Rinus and Mart for the supervision, weekly meetings, patience, advice and continuous feedback. Pieter for the help during the thesis and the feedback provided on this report. My friends around the globe that somehow overcame the distance and pushed me towards my goals. My Nijmegen friends for the daily advice, encouragement and occasional de-stressing parties. Last but not least, I would like to thank my family for the continuous support during these two last years. There is no doubt that I only made this far because of you. I love you. Specially, I would like to thank my parents for always trusting me and pointing me in the right direction.
