The \ac{iot} consists of a network of "things" (devices, computers, people, systems, etc) that interact with each other via the Internet. These components can exchange data, monitor and manage each other. \ac{iot} is a global, growing phenomenon. According to Gartner, there were 3.96 billion connected "things" in 2016 and by 2020, 12.863 billion devices are expected to be connected to the Internet~\cite{iot_numbers}. \ac{iot} is being used in a myriad of applications including house automation, fitness tracking, health care, warehouse monitoring, agriculture and industry manufacturing. \ac{iot} devices can be dedicated servers, personal computers, tablets, smartphones, smartwatches or compact devices operated by microcontrollers. Microcontrollers are small, cheap computers with limited resources and low power consumption commonly used to interface with the real world. They often gather data from sensors (movement, light, temperature, etc), act on actuators (motors, \acsp{led}, swtiches, etc) and communicate with other devices.

\ac{top} is a new programming paradigm used to develop online, collaborative applications. Its central concept, a \textit{Task}, can be used to model different types of work performed both by users and systems. \ac{top} provides a high level of abstraction, liberating the programmer from the burden of technical details, such as user interfaces. \ac{top} systems automatically generate as much assets as possible, turning it into a great tool for rapid prototyping. The iTasks~\cite{top} system implements \ac{top} in the functional programming language Clean~\cite{clean} as an \ac{edsl}. Given an iTasks program, the system automatically generates a web application that can be accessed via a web browser. Users can access this application to work on and inspect Tasks. The system has been proved useful in many fields, including incident response operations and navy vessels automation~\cite{incidone,navy}.


\section{Research Question}
Even though mTask was created to allow iTasks tasks to run on \acs{iot} devices, it has not been proved capable of running real life applications yet. The examples built during its development were simple demonstrations and were far from real life \acs{iot} applications. Given that, I propose the following research question:

Is it possible to develop real life, \acs{iot} applications using mTask? If so, how can the development process be improved? If not, what are the challenges to solve to make it possible?

I plan to tackle the research question by example. Namely, trying to develop a real life \acs{iot} application using mTask. The attempt to develop such an application should display mTask's capability to create real life applications while displaying new opportunities to improve the development process.

The application I chose to develop tackles a popular problem in \acrshort{iot}: house automation. This application would be responsible for automating simple house management tasks such as turning the central heating system off when the room is warm, or opening up the curtains at a set time. The proposed application requires several \acrshort{iot} devices equipped with sensors (temperature, light, humidity, etc.) and actuators (\acsp{led}, motors, relays, etc.) spread across rooms.
