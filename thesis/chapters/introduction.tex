\section{Introduction}
The \ac{iot} consists of a network of "things" (devices, computers, people, systems, etc) where its components interact with each other via the Internet. These components can exchange data, monitor and manage each other. \ac{iot} is a global, growing phenomenon. According to Gartner~\cite{iot_numbers}, there were 3.96 billion connected "things" in 2016 and by 2020, 12.863 billion devices are expected to be connected to the Internet. \ac{iot} is being used in a myriad of applications including house automation, fitness tracking, health care, warehouse monitoring, agriculture and industry manufacturing. \ac{iot} devices can be dedicated servers, personal computers, tablets, smartphones, smartwatches or compact devices operated by microcontrollers. Microcontrollers are small, cheap computers with limited resources and low power consumption commonly used to interface with the real world. They often gather data from sensors (movement, light, temperature, etc), act on actuators (motors, LEDs, swtiches, etc) and communicate with other devices.
