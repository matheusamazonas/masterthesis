\acf{top} is a new programming paradigm used to develop online collaborative applications~\cite{top}. In a \acs{top} application, users --- both people and other systems --- work together to accomplish a common goal~\cite{top}. Its central concept is called a task, an abstraction that can be used for many different types of work. This abstraction, along with other TOP concepts, allows the programmer to focus on design decisions instead of technical details. TOP programs are declarative: they focus on \textit{what} work should be performed, rather than on \textit{how} to perform it.

\section{iTasks}\label{itasks}
The iTasks system is an \acs{edsl} that implements the \acs{top} paradigm. Its host language is the pure and lazy functional programming language \textit{Clean}~\cite{clean}. iTasks uses generic programming to automatically generate code for user-specified first-order data types whilst also allowing for specialization. Given an iTasks program, the system generates code for both the server and the client.

An iTasks task is a function that transforms a state, reacts to events and returns an observable value. A task is represented by \texttt{Task a} and its observable value by \texttt{TaskValue a}, where \texttt{a} is the type of the task. A \texttt{TaskValue} contains the current state of the value that a Task is processing. The possible states of a \texttt{TaskValue} are shown on Figure \ref{fig:task_value}. As seen below, once a value stabilizes, it can not become unstable.

\caption{Possible states of a \texttt{TaskValue}}
\label{fig:task_value}
\end{figure}

A Task can be of any type, as long as it provides instances for the type classes in the \texttt{iTask} type class collection. These instances can be automatically derived or explicitly declared. Automatic derivation is available for any first-order type as long as it is not abstract. Basic types have instances already defined in the iTasks library. Explicit declaration allows the user to define custom instances of the \texttt{iTask} class collection if the default derived instance is not suitable. Moreover, it allows instances for extendable, abstract and the function types. 

\section{Interaction}\label{interaction}

The iTasks library provides basic tasks for user interaction. Listing \ref{l_top1} shows the three basic interactive tasks: \texttt{enterInformation}, \texttt{viewInformation} and \texttt{updateInformation}. They create user interface elements to enter, view and update information respectively. As seen in Listing \ref{l_top1}, these basic tasks include a class constraint on the type of the returned \texttt{Task}. This constraint enforces that the type \texttt{m} has an instance of the \texttt{iTask} type class. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=iTasks basic interaction functions,captionpos=b,label=l_top1]
enterInformation  :: d [EnterOption m]      -> Task m | iTask m
viewInformation   :: d [ViewOption m] m     -> Task m | iTask m
updateInformation :: d [UpdateOption m m] m -> Task m | iTask m 
\end{lstlisting}


Listing \ref{l_top2} displays examples of how to use the basic interactive tasks. First, a new \ac{adt} called \texttt{Location} is introduced. Next, its instance of \texttt{iTask} is automatically derived. Following, a new example \texttt{Location} is introduced. Finally, new tasks are defined in terms of the basic tasks presented in Listing \ref{l_top1}. 


\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example of basic iTasks interaction functions,captionpos=b,label=l_top2]
:: Location = { city :: String, state :: String }

derive class iTask Location

location :: Location
location = { city="Omaha", state="Nebraska" }

enterLocation :: Task Location
enterLocation = enterInformation "Enter the location" []

viewLocation :: Task Location
viewLocation = viewInformation "View the location" [] location

updateLocation :: Task Location
updateLocation = updateInformation "Update the location" [] location
\end{lstlisting}

Figure \ref{fig:itasks_display} displays the user interfaces generated for the basic tasks \texttt{enterInformation} (Figure \ref{fig:enter_info}), \texttt{viewInformation} (Figure \ref{fig:view_info}) and \texttt{updateInformation} (Figure \ref{fig:upd_info}).

\section{Combinators}\label{combinators}

Although the basic tasks introduced in Section \ref{interaction} allow the user to exchange information with the iTasks application, they are quite limited. In order to allow the user to express more complex behavior, task combinators were introduced. Combinators are functions (usually infix operators) that determine how its argument tasks will be combined into a new task. There are only two fundamental composition combinators: sequence and parallel~\cite{top_fl}. All the other combinators in the \texttt{iTask} library are derived from these fundamental combinators. Only the derived combinators will be discussed in this document.

\subsection{Sequential Combinators}

Tasks can be executed in sequence using the \texttt{>>*} combinator, also called the \textit{step} combinator. Its type signature can be seen on Listing \ref{seq_comb}. The step combinator takes a \texttt{Task a} and a list of task continuations as input. A task continuation defines a condition on when to execute another task. It is a predicate that runs on either user actions, task values or thrown exceptions.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Sequential combinators,label=seq_comb,captionpos=b]
(>>*) infixl 1 :: (Task a) [TaskCont a (Task b)] -> Task b | iTask a & iTask b

:: TaskCont a b                               
	= OnValue ((TaskValue a) -> Maybe b)         
	| OnAction Action ((TaskValue a) -> Maybe b) 
	| E.e: OnException (e -> b) & iTask e        
	| OnAllExceptions (String -> b)

(>>=) infixl 1 :: (m a) (a -> m b) -> m b   | iTask a & iTask b
(>>|) infixl 1 :: (m a) (m b)     -> m b   | iTask a & iTask b
\end{lstlisting}

The \texttt{>>=} (also called \textit{bind}) is an example of sequential combinator derived from the step combinator. Its first argument is the first task to be executed and its second arguments is a function that takes the first task's value as input and returns a task. The \texttt{>>|} combinator is derived from the bind combinator. It executes two tasks sequentially, but the value of the first task is disregarded. On both \texttt{>>=} and \texttt{>>|}, the second task is executed if either the value of the first task becomes stable, or it is unstable and the user presses a "Continue" button.

\subsection{Parallel Combinators}

Tasks can be executed in parallel using the \textit{parallel} combinator. All the other parallel combinators in the iTasks library are derived from it. Among them, \texttt{-\&\&-} and  \texttt{-||-} are the most commonly used. The first executes two tasks in parallel and returns a tuple containing the result of both argument tasks. The \texttt{-||-} combinator executes two tasks in parallel, but behaves differently from the \texttt{-\&\&-} combinator. The value of the combined task depends on the stability of the argument tasks. If none of the tasks are stable, the combined task yields the last modified non-stable value. If one of the values becomes stable, the combinator yields it, preserving its stability. The type signatures of both combinators can be seen on Listing \ref{par_comb}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Parallel combinators,label=par_comb,captionpos=b]
(-&&-) infixr 4 :: (Task a) (Task b) -> Task (a,b) | iTask a & iTask b
(-||-) infixr 3 :: (Task a) (Task a) -> Task a     | iTask a
\end{lstlisting}


\section{Shared Data Sources}

Albeit task combinators are a powerful tool to 
communicate values among tasks, some applications need to perform ad hoc communication with the external world. \acp{sds} abstract from implementation details on how resources are accessed. A resource can be, for example, a database, a file, the system time or a shared value in memory. 

One approach to create an abstract view on shared data is called a lens~\cite{lenses}. A lens is a bidirectional transformation that provides an interface for reading and writing shared data. Lenses can be extended to allow change notifications: a view is notified when the underlying shared data was modified. Thus, a view always presents updated information. This ability to listen for notifications is called \textit{observing}. Although change notifications are useful, each notification has communication and performance costs. When the shared data is relatively small and seldom updated, no problem arises. Although, if the data is represented by a large data structure that is often updated, broadcasting notifications might impact performance. 

This performance impact could be reduced if lenses were able to filter notifications based on which part of the underlying data was modified. Traditional lenses do not provide a mechanism to encode that information. Parametric lenses are an extension to traditional lenses that enable notification filtering according to a \textit{focus} domain~\cite{parametric}. This focus domain is used to encode notification predicates that tell whether a change on the underlying shared source affects the current view. This way, change notifications can be sent only to the views that are affected by the change, reducing unnecessary notifications.

\acp{sds} are implemented using parametric lenses. As it can be seen from Listing \ref{sds1}, an \texttt{SDS} has three type parameters. The first one is the type of the \textit{focus} domain. The second and third types are the read and write data types respectively. Note that they do not need to be the same type. A \texttt{ReadWriteShared} is an \ac{sds} where the focus domain is of type \texttt{()} (void). A \texttt{Shared} is a \texttt{ReadWriteShared} where read and write types are the same.

% SDS functions
There are four basic functions to operate on \acp{sds}: \textit{get}, \textit{set}, \textit{update} and \textit{watch}. Their type signatures can be seen on Listing \ref{sds1}. The \texttt{get} operation simply fetches the current value of an \ac{sds}. Analogously, the \texttt{set} function sets an \ac{sds}'s value. The \texttt{upd} operation sets the \ac{sds}'s value based on its current value. The \texttt{watch} function continuously reads the value of an \ac{sds}. The \texttt{get}, \texttt{set} and \texttt{update} operations are atomic: during a reading, no other operation is executed.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Shared Data Sources definitions,label=sds1,captionpos=b]
:: SDS p r w = ...
:: ReadWriteShared r w :== SDS () r w
:: Shared a :== SDS () a a

get   :: (ReadWriteShared a w)           -> Task a | iTask a
set   :: a (ReadWriteShared r a)         -> Task a | iTask a
upd   :: (r -> w) (ReadWriteShared r w)   -> Task w | iTask r & iTask w
watch :: (ReadWriteShared r w)           -> Task r | iTask r
\end{lstlisting}

\acp{sds} can be composed to create new \acp{sds} using combinators defined in the iTasks library. In addition, interactive tasks equivalent to the ones described in Section \ref{interaction} are defined for the type \texttt{ReadWriteShared}. Their signatures can be seen on Listing \ref{sds2}. Both of these interactive tasks \textit{observe} the \ac{sds}. Therefore, changes on the \texttt{ReadWriteShared} will be automatically displayed.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=\ac{sds} interactive tasks,label=sds2,captionpos=b]
viewSharedInformation ::   d [ViewOption r]     (ReadWriteShared r w) -> Task r | iTask r 
updateSharedInformation :: d [UpdateOption r w] (ReadWriteShared r w) -> Task r | iTask r & iTask w
\end{lstlisting}
