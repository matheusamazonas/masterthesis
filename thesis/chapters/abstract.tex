The \acl{iot} is becoming ubiquitous. A growing number of objects are being equipped with devices that interact with its environment and exchange data via the Internet. Such devices are not powerful enough to run \gls{iTasks} (an implementation of the \acl{top} paradigm written in \gls{clean}) applications. The \gls{mTask} \acl{edsl} was created with one goal in mind: to bring \acl{iot} devices and the \acl{top} paradigm together. But so far, only trivial applications were developed using \gls{mTask}. This thesis assesses whether \gls{mTask} can be used to develop real-life applications. \gls{autohouse}, 
the home automation application developed during the research, guided improvements in the \gls{mTask} development environment and unearthed problems yet to be resolved.
